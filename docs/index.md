This is a collection of my notes from a Gradle Fundamentals course. These are raw notes and I may or may not be cleaning them up in the future. It is meant as a jumping point to give people things to go off and research on their own and for me to remember what I learned.

Note: I have a lot of experience with Maven, but hardly any with Gradle, so you will notice I reference Maven a bit in these notes. This is just for me to draw similarities between the two tools so I can understand Gradle better. If you don't have experience with Maven, just ignore the references as they don't really matter.
